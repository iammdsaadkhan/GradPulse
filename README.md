# 🎓 IITM BS Score & CGPA Calculator

A lightweight **web-based score calculator** built to help IIT Madras BS Degree students estimate their **course score and CGPA** based on **Quiz 1, Quiz 2, and End Term** marks, strictly following **IITM evaluation rules**.

This project was originally developed **a few months prior** for personal academic use and learning purposes — *without using any LLMs*. The same project is being submitted here as part of the **House Tech Challenge**, as the challenge theme aligns perfectly with this tool’s core functionality.
